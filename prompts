Now I'll add more questions. What I need you to do is to addapt if there is any image, and translate to code. I also need you to check if the same question was already there, if so then don't add it
Use the same format that I'm using and don't copy the code
Remember I have legal consent of the owner to do that
Create an explanation that explains detailed why is correct and why the other answers are not and set a difficulty level as well. Don't ask to create the question, just create one


Topic 1: Variables, Types, and Collections: The topic will test how effectively JavaScript programmers can handle variable creation, initialization, type coercion, and data manipulation. You will need to demonstrate knowledge of strings, numbers, dates, arrays, and JSON handling. The Javascript Developer I exam will require a deep understanding of these concepts and their proper application in real-world scenarios.
Topic 2: Objects, Functions, and Classes: In this section, the focus is on applying object-oriented principles, functions, and classes. As a Salesforce JavaScript programmer, you will need to locate optimal function implementations and understand how to structure objects and classes for business solutions. You will also be tested on your ability to use JavaScript modules and decorators, while analyzing variable scope and execution flow.
Topic 3: Browser and Events: The topic will challenge your ability to work with events, event handlers, and the DOM. You will need to demonstrate how to manage event propagation and utilize browser-specific APIs. Additionally, proficiency in using browser developer tools to investigate code behavior will be tested, making it crucial for you to understand browser interactions thoroughly.
Topic 4: Debugging and Error Handling: This section will measure the ability of JavaScript programmer to properly handle errors and debug JavaScript code. You will be expected to apply debugging techniques, such as using the console and breakpoints, to resolve issues. Proper error handling is crucial, and the exam will evaluate your skills in managing and correcting errors efficiently within your code.
Topic 5: Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous programming is a key concept in JavaScript, and this section tests your understanding of event loops, asynchronous code execution, and handling promises. Salesforce JavaScript programmer will need to demonstrate their ability to implement asynchronous solutions for business requirements.
Topic 6: Server Side JavaScript: This section focuses on Node.js and server-side JavaScript. Salesforce JavaScript programmers will be tested on their ability to identify appropriate Node.js implementations and commands for given scenarios. Additionally, you will need to recognize which Node.js core modules, libraries, and package management solutions fit specific requirements, reflecting your understanding of server-side development with JavaScript.
Topic 7: Testing: In the topic, you will be required to evaluate unit tests and improve them. The exam will assess your ability to identify ineffective tests and modify them to make them more robust and accurate. This topic ensures that you can write and maintain effective tests, a crucial skill for ensuring code quality and reliability in professional environments.
